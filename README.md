# Python-chatroom


The Python chatroom was an idea I came up to test out my python skills. For the libraries that I used for this project it was. Tkinter and threading to create the client side. For the server side I uses threading mostly to set it up. I had the client side open up a simple GUI so it is more pleasing and looks more like a chatroom instead of having it run in terminal where it may get confusing and not an eyesore.
